I really like wristwatches.  This might come as a bit of a surprise to some, given that historically I have dedicated comparatively little time– pun intended– towards writing watch reviews for this blog with but a [couple](../2011/2011-12-30-invicta-3449-review.md) of [exceptions](../2013/2013-02-19-more-closet-treasures-fossil-abacus.md).  However, unlike the vast majority of wristwatch afficionados, I would not consider myself a so-called "collector" by any stretch of the imagination.

Sure, I currently own and regularly wear a handful of wristwatches, but I wouldn't consider myself to be a fan of classical [_haute holology_](https://www.watch-wiki.net/index.php?title=Haute_Horlogerie).  Luxury watches simply don't appeal to me in the way they do to many of the mainstream watch collectors one finds on YouTube.  Rolex?  Not for me.  Audemars Piguet?  Too much bling.

That isn't to say there are some luxury watches that tickle my fancy.  Richard Mille, with their wire-suspended custom movements, or Piaget, for pushing the boundary of just how thin a mechanical watch can be made.  However the watches from those companies are, quite simply, astronomically priced.  The value they provide simply doesn't seem worth it compared to more similar and yet more economical models made by Casio or Swatch.  I recognize that the R&D effort to design and build [Rafael Nadal's Richard Mille](https://www.richardmille.com/friends-and-partners/rafael-nadal) compared to a Casio G-Shock is akin to designing ceramic tiles for the Space Shuttle versus clay bricks for a fire pit, but given that the likelihood of tending a backyard fire is mucher for most of us as opposed to hurtling through the atmosphere at 17,000 miles-per-hour, I think the cheaper option will do just fine for my use cases.

Perhaps my mentality stems from my personal history of owning watches that were both budget-friendly as well as extremely useful.  Take, for example, one of the first watches I ever remember owning: the Radio Shack 63-5021 calculator watch from 1999.  (Or so I think, anyway.  I can't find any good information about it online.)  This was a more-or-less impulse purchase by my dad, who purchased two identical units on the spot for my brother and I when we accompanied him to Radio Shack when I was a kid.  Despite the fact that I didn't have much reason to _use_ a calculator watch– I was only 9 or so years old at the time– I fondly remember that watch returning to my wrist intermittently through 5th grade until the keypad finally bit the dust.

Then there was the Casio W-736H-2AV, my first ever Casio watch.  Featuring a built-in vibrating alarm, it was responsible for waking me up every morning without pestering my brother with whom I shared a room.  Of course it didn't do me much good once I stopped wearing a wristwatch to bed, but that didn't change the fact that it was a watch with a unique feature and I thought it was cool at the time.

Nowhere near as cool, however, as my next Casio watch: the Pro Trek PRT-40.  A beast of a watch, my brother and I again acquired matching (albeit in different color schemes) timepieces while on a family vacation in Hong Kong.  Equipped with Casio's first-gen ABC (Altimeter, Barometer, Compass (and Thermometer, which somehow never made the cut for the acronym)) sensor, a big LCD featuring a small array section for graphs, and indiglo backlighting, this was a go-anywhere, do-everything watch for the active outdoorsman.  Being only 12 years old at the time, that description obviously didn't fit me.  But I was far more interested in what my watch was capable of as opposed to what I myself was actually doing.
