I came across this little guy while doing my homework at starbucks. This video gives you a good idea of the variable-focus capabilities of the iPhone 4, as well as the surprisingly good video quality. I apologize for the focus point being not-quite on the ladybug, but ah well. It's a good example anyways. (Oh, and it is possible to change the focus point / exposure mid-video, which is very cool.)<br/><object height="350" width="425"><br/>      <param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/bo5J4fuzN1Q&hl=en_US&fs=1?rel=0&hd=1"><br/>      <param name="wmode" value="transparent"><br/>      <embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/bo5J4fuzN1Q&hl=en_US&fs=1?rel=0&hd=1;rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" height="350" width="425"><br/>      </object>
