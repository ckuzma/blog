That's mostly because Twitter has changed its API formatting, and partly because using OAuth authentication is now a requirement.<br /><br />Until my Arduino-compatible WiFi radio arrives, however, most of the code written for the Arduino is more or less useless to me anyway, as I have to physically tether through my computer in order to access the internet. So why not just build upon <a href="http://blog.christopherkuzma.com/2014/10/wittydevices-twitterwit-nlp-applications.html" target="_blank">my last project</a> and build a health bar symbolizing Twitter's mood in live time? I set out to write a new Java interface to do just that, leaving my existing Arduino program untouched.<br /><br />The result is a program that queries Twitter for the most recent tweets containing the hashtags <i>#happy</i>&nbsp;and <i>#sad</i>. Based upon the ratio of them, a not-very-descriptive "happy value" is derived, with 30 being entirely happy tweets observed and 0 being the exact opposite. It's an oversimplification of what hashtags actually mean, but for the time being it at least does manage to cause a seemingly random pattern of lights to illuminate on the breadboard connected to the Arduino.<br /><br />I'm planning on working things to derive a more accurate scale of happiness, but for now I'm sharing the code as-is for your enjoyment (and suggestions).
