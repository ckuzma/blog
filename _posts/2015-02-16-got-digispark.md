For those who haven't heard of it before, the Digispark is an Arduino-compatible microcontroller board that is designed to be plugged directly into a computer's USB port- no cables necessary.<br /><br />Why did I get it? I'm not sure I have a good answer for that. It might have been my desire to educate my less-techy colleagues about the unique attributes of an Arduino compared to something more powerful (like <a href="http://meinfruhstuck.blogspot.com/2015/02/beaglebone-black-my-personal-cloud.html" target="_blank">a BeagleBone Black</a>). Or maybe I got it because I liked its diminutive size and the resulting ease with which it could be built into a piece of programmable art.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cQshugn7M80/VOJ8B8Fb0xI/AAAAAAAAGoc/RMj8om4ASvg/s1600/IMG_20150209_190117856.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cQshugn7M80/VOJ8B8Fb0xI/AAAAAAAAGoc/RMj8om4ASvg/s1600/IMG_20150209_190117856.jpg" height="300" width="400" /></a></div><br /><span id="goog_1398853628"></span>My impressions of the board so far are rather mixed. While its design is undoubtedly clever, the lack of built-in serial debugging over USB is a bit of a downer. Having to use a separate, repackaged version of the Arduino IDE that has been modified to interface with the Digispark's bootloader is, quite frankly, annoying as well.<br /><br />That being said, for all intensive purposes this little microcontroller should do its job quite well. For the few bucks I paid, it ought to be right at home built into an art project or serving as a learning tool for my friends.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EsZ_6HpJ3l0/VOJ8RuaB7tI/AAAAAAAAGog/ZeosXZaTLMs/s1600/IMG_20150209_190212525.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EsZ_6HpJ3l0/VOJ8RuaB7tI/AAAAAAAAGog/ZeosXZaTLMs/s1600/IMG_20150209_190212525.jpg" height="400" width="300" /></a></div><br />
