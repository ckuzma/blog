Taking it apart and messing with the innards isn't really an expected course of action. However when my friend Felix bestowed his fruity tune-playing device upon me, that's exactly what he had in mind. You see, this iPod had a problem, and Felix figured I'd love it all the more because of it.<br /><br />What exactly was amiss with this 6th-generation iPod Nano was anyone's guess. While iTunes registered it just fine and syncing commenced without a hitch, it wasn't obvious why the screen wouldn't turn on. Purely on a hunch I figured that the LCD backlight must have bit the dust, and decided to rip the thing apart and figure out exactly where it had failed. A few burnt fingers and a couple of lost screws later, and the thing was splayed open upon my desk.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UtbM7c6Vkew/UfBqIzDJ3AI/AAAAAAAADpw/s0tBqqFduPI/s1600/IMG_20130724_123512.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UtbM7c6Vkew/UfBqIzDJ3AI/AAAAAAAADpw/s0tBqqFduPI/s320/IMG_20130724_123512.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br />At this point I tried to a few different things in an attempt to breath life back into the LED backlight system. I wiped the motherboard with a swab dipped in alcohol, checked that all of the ribbon cable connectors were functioning properly, etc. Nothing seemed to work, but at least I tried. A few minutes later and I'd ordered a new display assembly, as it seemed as though the LED backlight array itself was faulty, not anything else.<br /><br />When I realized it'd be a few weeks before I'd take delivery of the new assembly, I became a bit disheartened. I wanted to play with the thing, and I wanted to do it now. That got me to thinking; why not remove the light seal of the LCD panel and use ambient light to illuminate it instead? Once I'd done this, I felt compelled to mount everything to a piece of cardboard for the sake of sturdiness. The hardest part of all of this was aligning the display assembly with a hole I'd cut in the board to allow for light to pass through, but all told this took only fifteen minutes to patch together.<br /><br />Overall, the creation came out better than I'd expected. It's even pocketable. Something tells me that even Sir Jonathan Ive would at least be amused by it.<br /><br /><br />
