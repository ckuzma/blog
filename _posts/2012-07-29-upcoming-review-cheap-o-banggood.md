What's important now, is this: I got a bluetooth stereo-speaker for the <i>extremely</i>&nbsp;low price of $4.30 shipped to my door. From eBay. Want to know the crazy part? It now sells for about $25 shipped, and knowing what I do now about it... even that price is totally worth it. Easily one of my best purchases ever. Review coming up soon in which I liken it to the Jawbone Jambox and similar.
