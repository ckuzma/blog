Afterwards, I compare the pictures to one another and eliminate the ones I deem unnecessary or superfluous. The above image is an example of one of the captures that ultimately get the boot, which normally would make a beeline to my computer's recycle (or in the case of an Apple computer, trash) bin, but because I haven't posted anything recently I've decided to share it here with you.<br /><br />Enjoy! The review of that tablet will be coming here shortly, I promise.
