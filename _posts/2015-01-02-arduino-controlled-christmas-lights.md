These are typically synchronized to music and generally serve to make ordinary holiday decorations look, well, kind of boring. I used to watch these videos and wonder at the amount of time that was spent building and installing them. Surely such a project was one I'd never bother with.<br /><br />That is until I realized I had most of the parts necessary to build such a thing right under my own nose. This year I decided to find out just how hard it really is to build a custom light show. I disassembled my <a href="http://blog.christopherkuzma.com/2014/10/wittydevices-twitterwit-nlp-applications.html" target="_blank">@WittyDevices project</a>, picked up a couple of new parts, and got to work.<br /><br /><b>Parts used:</b><br /><ul><li>1 x 4-socket Electrical Box</li><li>2 x 2-plug Sockets</li><li>1 x 4-channel Relay Switch Board</li><li>1 x Arduino Uno R3 Kit w/Wires</li><li>Spare wiring, solder, time, etc.</li></ul><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ysKcYUo7f8M/VKcaEWFncQI/AAAAAAAAGao/W7tG99ruTAI/s1600/relays.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ysKcYUo7f8M/VKcaEWFncQI/AAAAAAAAGao/W7tG99ruTAI/s1600/relays.jpg" height="225" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">4-channel relay wired up and glued into the electrical box.</td></tr></tbody></table>The most important part of this project is the relay board. Arduino controllers aren't built to handle the 120v output of a standard wall plug. This is the first and most obvious obstacle that needs to be overcome in this project. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relay" target="_blank">Relays</a> are a great way to handle the problem, taking lower voltage commands from a control circuit and applying them to isolated circuits operating at much greater voltages. For simplicity's sake (and my own safety), I decided to purchase a prebuilt board instead of attempting to build one myself.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZtLY-5OgFWU/VKcbcM3zfDI/AAAAAAAAGa0/NTrqRYhW3PM/s1600/all-pieces.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZtLY-5OgFWU/VKcbcM3zfDI/AAAAAAAAGa0/NTrqRYhW3PM/s1600/all-pieces.jpg" height="225" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Sockets with plug numbers marked.</td></tr></tbody></table>In the interest of safety I also decided that it would be better to encapsulate everything within an electrical box. I also decided against splicing perfectly good wire leads off of light strings and hardwiring them directly to the relay switches. Instead, I purchased a couple of 2-plug wall sockets to install into an electrical box and hardwired leads from those to the relay switches. The result is a portable box that can have lights (or other electrical appliances) installed and removed quite easily. While I could have easily crammed everything into a smaller box, the four-socket box afforded me a welcome amount of room in which to work.<br /><br />With everything wired up and tested for faults, I connected my Arduino board to the relay switch and loaded it up with a sketch timed to match&nbsp;<i>Joy to the World</i>. <a href="https://github.com/ckuzma/ArduinoXmasRelayLights/blob/master/Joy_to_the_World.ino" target="_blank">The code</a> for which I borrowed from an <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Christmas-Light-Controller/" target="_blank">Instructable which demonstrated how to build an 8-channel relay board from scratch</a>. (Thanks, <a href="http://www.instructables.com/member/dany32412/" target="_blank">dany32412</a>!) Despite only running a 4-channel relay system, the results were quite fantastic, as you can see in the video above when I plugged in some actual light strings to the system.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CGjVa86H_wM/VKceCPblUNI/AAAAAAAAGbI/5WevA6DHuVA/s1600/setup-closeup.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CGjVa86H_wM/VKceCPblUNI/AAAAAAAAGbI/5WevA6DHuVA/s1600/setup-closeup.JPG" height="263" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Hooked up to lights outside.</td></tr></tbody></table>The cost to build my system? Just under twenty-six dollars in total. There are probably cheaper ways to have built the same thing, but I deemed it an acceptable expenditure, especially considering how I needed all of the parts for my next project.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7hjpWpfnzCE/VKcerZUnq9I/AAAAAAAAGbQ/lJQYkZx_sHQ/s1600/setup.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7hjpWpfnzCE/VKcerZUnq9I/AAAAAAAAGbQ/lJQYkZx_sHQ/s1600/setup.JPG" height="400" width="265" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">The final product.</td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: center;"><i>[Before attempting to replicate my project, be sure to know what you are doing before working with live power circuits.
