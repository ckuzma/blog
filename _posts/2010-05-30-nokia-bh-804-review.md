Crikey. Somehow I managed to forget about describing the headset @WOMWorldNokia sent me along with the Nokia E72. So here we go, the fastest review you’ll ever read. The Nokia BH-804 is a great headset. Lightweight, built of quality materials, with a great design and neat docking station. Stays placed in one’s ear exceptionally well. However, when I tried to test it, it would always emit a loud screeching noise in my ear, resulting in a frantic effort to rip it out of my ear. Do I recommend it? Not the one I got. Maybe it was buggy. But something’s up with that, big time.
