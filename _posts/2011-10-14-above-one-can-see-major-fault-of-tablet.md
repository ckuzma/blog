Either a stand or cradle/dock is required and that makes the idea of a simple tablet into something more complicated than the netbook or laptop it replaces. My solution to this situation was going to take one of two routes: purchase a case which doubles as a stand or purchase a dedicated stand. I revised this plan soon after when I found out that most of the cases designed with stand-duties in mind are absolutely pitiful to look at and the stands on offer were either cheap in nature or they falter in practical design execution. <p>The solution, then, was obvious. I merely had to figure out which route to take: build a stand which is collapsible and possible to take with me on a day-to-day basis?... or should I build a more permanent prop to be left at home where my keyboard for my iPad normall resides anyway. The route I took, at least for the moment, was the latter, and the abve picture stands testament to my efforts. A bit of cardboard, hot glue and elementary knowledge of successful support design was all that was necessary.
