Whereas my peers elected to base their projects on popular public figures, I decided to rise above the mundane… My subject was the Easter bunny.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">While it might have been expected that my presentation be met with snickers and teasing, it instead encountered a considerable amount of debate. What was supposed to be a five minute speech very soon became a thirty minute discussion. Were someone not familiar with my imaginary subject, they might have mistaken the opinions being voiced to have been a description belonging to a real, if furtive, rabbit. Each of my peers had their own take on the Easter bunny’s persona and none of them were quite willing to abandon it despite admitting to the character’s imaginary existence.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">That presentation experience, which did render me an A+ project grade, was a delightful example of a healthy debate. Not one of my peers were ready to abandon their idealized image of a fictional rabbit, yet none of them were in the slightest way offended by their neighbors’ differing views on the matter. And that’s what healthy debate is supposed to be.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">Which leads me into a question that I came up with yesterday… what does Superman dream about? If he were to have a dream in which he exists as a normal human being, would he view this as a horrific experience or a refreshing liberation from his supernatural calling?<o:p></o:p></div>
