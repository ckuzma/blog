### Adventures in 3D Printing: Garage Remote Fob Holder

![Finished holder](posts/2022/media/garage_fob/img001.jpeg)

Partially as an experiment, and partially because I was fed up of my apartment building's garage door remote fob working itself into hard-to-reach places, I decided to make [a project out of designing and printing a clip for the darn thing](https://github.com/ckuzma/garage-door-keyfob-holder) that would enable me to attach it somewhere convenient in my car and trust it to remain there.

One of the requirements I placed on myself was to somehow mimic a "traditional" garage door remote-- those non-descript black boxes with flexible steel clips attached to them-- while also using as little print material as possible.  I also wanted to give some of these away to friends of mine in the building so it also needed to look refined enough that they would actually use it and not just chuck it in the trash.

### Photos: Cricket 80A Soldering Project

![cricket_80a_01.jpg](posts/2022/media/cricket_80a/cricket_80a_01.jpg)

There's not much of a story to go with this post, I just thought it would be fun to share some photos.  As a result of my participation in a Hackster contest, I found myself sitting upon some [Tindie](https://www.tindie.com) store credit and decided to put it towards a [Cricket 80A, a ham radio transceiver designed by "NMÃ˜S"](http://4sqrp.com/cricket.php) for CW (read: Morse) operation.  What follows are some photos taken while I was soldering components to the board as well as a final one showing the board in operation with its signal being picked up by my HackRF One.

### Adventures in 3D Printing: VFD Clock Minimalist Housing

![GIF of VFD clock](posts/2022/media/vfd_clock/vfd_header.GIF)

I'm not sure if anyone reading this is aware, but I [really](../2013/2013-02-19-more-closet-treasures-fossil-abacus.md) [like](../2020/2020-04-08-nixie-tube-box-case-part-1.md) [timekeeping](../2020/2020-09-08-casio-pro-trek-prw-3100-review.md) [devices](../2020/2020-03-30-rgb-wall-display-board-part-3.md).  While I have a soft spot for all things mechanical, I do enjoy the myriad of "digital" display technologies that can be employed by clock circuitry.  One of those happens to be the basically-obsolete VFD (vacuum flourescent display) tube.  Similar to the modern AMOLED panel, the pixels in the matrix of a VFD are self-emitting.  Unlike the more modern counterpart, VFDs require significantly higher voltage similar to that of a Nixie tube.

A couple of years ago, whilst trawling the open waters of the internet (read: AliExpress), I stumbled across a simple and cheap VFD clock.  While it's not the most intricate VFD clock out there, I was rather struck by its legible display reminding me quite a bit of the one adorning the face of my grandfather's HiFi audio amplifier.  In-person it was quite enjoyable to look at, but unfortunately it stopped working reliably after a few months.  Being unable to troubleshoot it myself, I took the circuitry and display out of its extruded aluminum housing to save space and put it into my parts bin.

### Kano PC Review

![kano pc](posts/2021/media/kano/01.jpeg)

# Introduction

The Kano PC is perhaps best described as a full-fledged modular Windows tablet-computer designed for kids.  It features an Intel Celeron CPU, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of eMMC solid-state storage, an 11.6" touchscreen and a case that doubles as a keyboard reminiscent of a Microsoft Surface device.  But far more important than the device's hardware specifications is its purpose: to inspire curious minds.

# Unboxing and Assembly

That just-mentioned important purpose makes itself known immediately in that the Kano PC ships unassembled.  That is to say, partly unassembled.  Compared to the previous Raspberry Pi-based computers released under the Kano name, the Kano PC is not quite as demanding when it comes to its assembly procedure.  Perhaps that's a good thing, as Kano's previous offerings were potentially too complicated and fragile even for the parents of the target age audience.

![silkscreen micro sd details](posts/2021/media/kano/14.jpeg)

The gist of the assembly experience this time around is: unpack all of the components from the product packaging, connect the blue loudspeaker to the computer's exposed motherboard via an internal 2.5mm audio jack, plug in the red lithium-ion battery via a neighboring USB-C port, and then snap on the clear plastic housing to keep everything protected.  That's it.  No miniscule Micro SD cards to lose under the couch, no RAM cards to install, no fiddly ribbon cables or power lines to mess with this go around.
