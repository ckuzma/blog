### Nixie Tube Clock Box Case - Part 1

A few days short of exactly a year ago, I purchased a Nixie tube clock to give to my mother on Mother's Day 2019.  The clock I selected for her was housed in a beautifully finished wood base complete with multiple number-transition effects and selectable brightness levels.  Despite my best attempts to resist the appeal of the warm-glowing aesthetic, I soon found myself desiring my own clock.

### RGB Wall Display Board, Part 3: Finished!

It's been a long time coming but the light board project is finally complete.  Taking advantage of my newfound time spent sheltering indoors as the world battles the infectious spread of COVID-19, I managed to dedicate three days' worth of full-time attention to the final assembly of my _"RGB Light Board Mk.2"_.  At long last it is mounted proudly in my living room above my couch, ready to run whatever visualization algorithms I can imagine.

But first, a quick recap of how we got to this point:
- Part 1: [The Project Begins](https://github.com/ckuzma/blog/blob/master/posts/2020/2020-02-05-rgb-wall-display-board-part-1.md)
- Part 2: [Cutting and Wiring](https://github.com/ckuzma/blog/blob/master/posts/2020/2020-02-09-rgb-wall-display-board-part-2.md)
- Part 2.5: [Ported Code](https://github.com/ckuzma/blog/blob/master/posts/2020/2020-03-22-ported-code.md)
- Part 3: [Finished!](https://github.com/ckuzma/blog/blob/master/posts/2020/2020-03-30-rgb-wall-display-board-part-3.md) (This post.)

Finishing the board wound up being a lot more labor- and time-intensive than expected.  To start with, I had to create some board/box reinforcement pieces out of a large piece of 2x2.  In an attempt to cut down on the amount of sawdust created (and to hopefully make a cleaner cut), I opted to use my Japanese razor saw for this.
