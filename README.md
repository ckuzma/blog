### Teardown: HackRF One Portapack H2

In [a recent previous post documenting the assembly of an amateur radio transceiver kit](2022-01-16-cricket-80a-soldering.md), I shared a picture depicting the functional operation of the completed radio.  Specifically, I utilized the display on a a HackRF One in a Portpack H2 housing to demonstrate the transceiver's transmission within the expected frequency band, as well as functioning on/off pulses as is required for CW mode communication.

What I neglected to do at the time was hint that the assembled Cricket was not the only radio transceiver in the photo that had required a bit of DIY handiwork.  For, you see, the HackRF device itself had required a bit of repair/improvement, too.  Namely: when I received it, I was rather stunned by what sounded like a loose battery rattling around inside.  Given the propensity of Lithium batteries to do alarming things when damaged or even looked at for too long, I decided to rip apart my (preassembled) Portapack H2 to figure out some way to protect its heart.

### Adventures in 3D Printing: Garage Remote Fob Holder

![Finished holder](posts/2022/media/garage_fob/img001.jpeg)

Partially as an experiment, and partially because I was fed up of my apartment building's garage door remote fob working itself into hard-to-reach places, I decided to make [a project out of designing and printing a clip for the darn thing](https://github.com/ckuzma/garage-door-keyfob-holder) that would enable me to attach it somewhere convenient in my car and trust it to remain there.

One of the requirements I placed on myself was to somehow mimic a "traditional" garage door remote-- those non-descript black boxes with flexible steel clips attached to them-- while also using as little print material as possible.  I also wanted to give some of these away to friends of mine in the building so it also needed to look refined enough that they would actually use it and not just chuck it in the trash.

### Photos: Cricket 80A Soldering Project

![cricket_80a_01.jpg](posts/2022/media/cricket_80a/cricket_80a_01.jpg)

There's not much of a story to go with this post, I just thought it would be fun to share some photos.  As a result of my participation in a Hackster contest, I found myself sitting upon some [Tindie](https://www.tindie.com) store credit and decided to put it towards a [Cricket 80A, a ham radio transceiver designed by "NMÃ˜S"](http://4sqrp.com/cricket.php) for CW (read: Morse) operation.  What follows are some photos taken while I was soldering components to the board as well as a final one showing the board in operation with its signal being picked up by my HackRF One.

### Adventures in 3D Printing: VFD Clock Minimalist Housing

![GIF of VFD clock](posts/2022/media/vfd_clock/vfd_header.GIF)

I'm not sure if anyone reading this is aware, but I [really](../2013/2013-02-19-more-closet-treasures-fossil-abacus.md) [like](../2020/2020-04-08-nixie-tube-box-case-part-1.md) [timekeeping](../2020/2020-09-08-casio-pro-trek-prw-3100-review.md) [devices](../2020/2020-03-30-rgb-wall-display-board-part-3.md).  While I have a soft spot for all things mechanical, I do enjoy the myriad of "digital" display technologies that can be employed by clock circuitry.  One of those happens to be the basically-obsolete VFD (vacuum flourescent display) tube.  Similar to the modern AMOLED panel, the pixels in the matrix of a VFD are self-emitting.  Unlike the more modern counterpart, VFDs require significantly higher voltage similar to that of a Nixie tube.

A couple of years ago, whilst trawling the open waters of the internet (read: AliExpress), I stumbled across a simple and cheap VFD clock.  While it's not the most intricate VFD clock out there, I was rather struck by its legible display reminding me quite a bit of the one adorning the face of my grandfather's HiFi audio amplifier.  In-person it was quite enjoyable to look at, but unfortunately it stopped working reliably after a few months.  Being unable to troubleshoot it myself, I took the circuitry and display out of its extruded aluminum housing to save space and put it into my parts bin.
