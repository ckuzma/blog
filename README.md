### [Afternoon Project: HMT Watch Regulation](posts/2022/2022-03-18-hmt-tuning.md)

![HMT movement](posts/2022/media/hmt_watch/hmt01.gif)

Perhaps against my better judgement I ordered myself a "refurbished" HMT wristwatch on eBay about two months ago.  A hand-wound, 17-jewel, Indian-made watch for less than $15 shipped?  I couldn't resist.

As it turns out, you get what you pay for.  My particular watch's case turned out not to be water or dust resistant in the slightest, the crystal has a habit of popping off if it is knocked just right, the hour hand doesn't exactly line up with the dial's indices and the movement in mine was running worryingly slow.  Removing the screwdown caseback revealed a surprisingly corroded movement spacer but an otherwise okay-looking movement.  A few days and some fine adjustments of the regulator and I had the watch keeping acceptable time.  (Meaning, for me, a few seconds fast per day.)

Unfortunately I don't think I'll be wearing this watch very often.  While it is quite thin and comfortable I simply can't help but worry about it in ways that never even cross my mind when I'm wearing the G-Shock from the picture above.  So for now, this little hand-wound piece is relegated to the watch case where it stands as the only HMT in my collection.

In the [last installment of my 3D printed carriage clock project](posts/2022/2022-01-17-carriage-clock-pt2.md) I discovered that there were a number of fitment issues with my design and had decided to start with a clean slate and a focus on refinement.  To that end it was no longer acceptable for the clock to simply look like a box; it needed to actually resemble the carriage clocks of old once it was put together.  Additionally I wanted each major component to be easily replaced in case any of my prints failed or the part itself broke during assembly.

Having previously [designed and printed a functional movement mount and interlocking system](posts/2022/2022-01-16-carriage-clock-pt1.md) to attach it to the rest of the clock, I was ready to move forward with the rest of the clock body.  Namely the housing/case with its windows and access door.  I happened to have some "spare" white PLA filament and knowing the likelihood that components would have to be printed twice due to unaccounted-for stresses and tolerance variances, I decided to print out my work-in-progress CAD model to see how everything fit together.

Have I ever mentioned before that I really like [timekeeping devices](2022-01-15-vfd-clock-frame.md)?  Even though my first ever wristwatch was, if I remember correctly, a Timex with a digital display, I have always been absolutely enamored by the purely mechanical variety.  That's not to say I can't appreciate a decent [digital](../2020/2020-09-08-casio-pro-trek-prw-3100-review.md), [quartz](../2011/2011-12-30-invicta-3449-review.md), or mecha-quartz timepiece, mind you.  I just love the history, intricacy, and rythmic ticking of a mechanical watch or clock.  Even though they lag in accuracy and must be wound up daily (or worn, in the case of an automatic), I enjoy them immensely.

One can ~~blame~~ credit my parents for this love affair of mine.  From the ancient grandfather clock adjacent to the not-so-ancient grand piano in the living room of their house to the assortment of antique wall clocks forming an ensemble in the main hallway, I've always been surrounded by mechanical wonders.  While not all of them worked, I found myself drawn to my father's surprisingly-functional brass Waterbury carriage clock.  Small enough to be held in one hand yet dense enough to sit solidly atop a stack of papers, I remember spending a full week regulating its escapement to be more or less accurate, MacGyvering a non-permanent paperclip-based fix for the sheared-off pins of the rear door, and generally spending hours staring at the little movement ticking away when I should have been focused on my math homework instead.

Now, as an adult, armed with a 3D printer and mechanical clock movement, I think you can see where this is going.
