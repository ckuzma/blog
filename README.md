### Photos: Cricket 80A Soldering Project

![cricket_80a_01.jpg](posts/2022/media/cricket_80a/cricket_80a_01.jpg)

There's not much of a story to go with this post, I just thought it would be fun to share some photos.  As a result of my participation in a Hackster contest, I found myself sitting upon some [Tindie](https://www.tindie.com) store credit and decided to put it towards a [Cricket 80A, a ham radio transceiver designed by "NMÃ˜S"](http://4sqrp.com/cricket.php) for CW (read: Morse) operation.  What follows are some photos taken while I was soldering components to the board as well as a final one showing the board in operation with its signal being picked up by my HackRF One.

### Adventures in 3D Printing: VFD Clock Minimalist Housing

![GIF of VFD clock](posts/2022/media/vfd_clock/vfd_header.GIF)

I'm not sure if anyone reading this is aware, but I [really](../2013/2013-02-19-more-closet-treasures-fossil-abacus.md) [like](../2020/2020-04-08-nixie-tube-box-case-part-1.md) [timekeeping](../2020/2020-09-08-casio-pro-trek-prw-3100-review.md) [devices](../2020/2020-03-30-rgb-wall-display-board-part-3.md).  While I have a soft spot for all things mechanical, I do enjoy the myriad of "digital" display technologies that can be employed by clock circuitry.  One of those happens to be the basically-obsolete VFD (vacuum flourescent display) tube.  Similar to the modern AMOLED panel, the pixels in the matrix of a VFD are self-emitting.  Unlike the more modern counterpart, VFDs require significantly higher voltage similar to that of a Nixie tube.

A couple of years ago, whilst trawling the open waters of the internet (read: AliExpress), I stumbled across a simple and cheap VFD clock.  While it's not the most intricate VFD clock out there, I was rather struck by its legible display reminding me quite a bit of the one adorning the face of my grandfather's HiFi audio amplifier.  In-person it was quite enjoyable to look at, but unfortunately it stopped working reliably after a few months.  Being unable to troubleshoot it myself, I took the circuitry and display out of its extruded aluminum housing to save space and put it into my parts bin.

### Kano PC Review

![kano pc](posts/2021/media/kano/01.jpeg)

# Introduction

The Kano PC is perhaps best described as a full-fledged modular Windows tablet-computer designed for kids.  It features an Intel Celeron CPU, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of eMMC solid-state storage, an 11.6" touchscreen and a case that doubles as a keyboard reminiscent of a Microsoft Surface device.  But far more important than the device's hardware specifications is its purpose: to inspire curious minds.

# Unboxing and Assembly

That just-mentioned important purpose makes itself known immediately in that the Kano PC ships unassembled.  That is to say, partly unassembled.  Compared to the previous Raspberry Pi-based computers released under the Kano name, the Kano PC is not quite as demanding when it comes to its assembly procedure.  Perhaps that's a good thing, as Kano's previous offerings were potentially too complicated and fragile even for the parents of the target age audience.

![silkscreen micro sd details](posts/2021/media/kano/14.jpeg)

The gist of the assembly experience this time around is: unpack all of the components from the product packaging, connect the blue loudspeaker to the computer's exposed motherboard via an internal 2.5mm audio jack, plug in the red lithium-ion battery via a neighboring USB-C port, and then snap on the clear plastic housing to keep everything protected.  That's it.  No miniscule Micro SD cards to lose under the couch, no RAM cards to install, no fiddly ribbon cables or power lines to mess with this go around.

### Adventures in 3D Printing: Dipole Antenna

![Finished dipole and mount on railing](posts/2021/media/dipole/finished_02.png)

> The completed dipole antenna and railing bracket / arms mounted to the railing of my apartment's balcony.

During the winter of 2020 I decided to jump into a new hobby: amateur radio.  My first contacts were made with a Baofeng UV-5R, the same handheld transceiver that many HAMs get started with these days.  However it wasn't long until I began to lament the inconveniences of using an HT ("Handy Talkie" in HAM parlance).  Standing in just the right spot to transmit and receive successfully meant I rarely attempted a simplex conversation with my licensed coworker just down the road, and partaking in the evenings nets on the local repeater was usually limited to an in-and-out check-in.

The obvious solution to me at the time was to fit a better antenna on my radio.  While this did seem to help marginally, the almost-a-faraday-cage that was my apartment rendered the upgrade mostly moot.  What I thus decided I needed was a more powerful radio transceiver and a fixed external antenna.  While the former would require significant work to build myself, I decided that I was handy enough to design and create the latter with ease.
