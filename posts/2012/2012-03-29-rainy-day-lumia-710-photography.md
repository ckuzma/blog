Equipped with a Nokia Lumia 710, a jelly stick-on wide-angle lens and kept inside on account of the rain, I decided to see what I could accomplish that would please the photographer inside of me. After the break you'll find the results of my efforts, all of which were lightly touched in Photoshop to reduce noise (it's a dark day both inside and out) and kick up the saturation just a little bit to the point that is realistic but nowhere near the point of being overblown.
