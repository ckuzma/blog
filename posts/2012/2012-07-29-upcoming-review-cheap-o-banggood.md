There's a whole back-story to why I bought this, but I'll share that later on in the review. What's important now, is this: I got a bluetooth stereo-speaker for the extremely low price of $4.30 shipped to my door. From eBay. Want to know the crazy part? It now sells for about $25 shipped, and knowing what I do now about it... even that price is totally worth it. Easily one of my best purchases ever. Review coming up soon in which I liken it to the Jawbone Jambox and similar.
