Oregon doesn't get a lot of sunshine. Only about two or three months out of the year are characteristic for their sunny weather, with the other nine or so filled with gray skies and constant rain for the most part. There are the few odd breaks from the dreary wet weather, and today was one of them. With such exceptional weather, I couldn't resist but fire up the old '49 Plymouth and take it out for a spin. Photographs were taken, naturally.

That's it! Just felt like sharing a few photos that I thought came out well. Hope you enjoy them!
