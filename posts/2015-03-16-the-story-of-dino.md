Back in 2008, then-Nokia Connects (now Lumia Conversations) sent me a rather curious little plastic toy dinosaur. He was named Maptor belonged to a trio of fictional characters called Mapsters promoting Nokia's mapping software (now called Here). They were Godzilla-like creatures that were benign navigators as opposed to city destructors, and appeared in promotions such as this website (YouTube video as the website is no longer available).

I was living in Phoenix, Arizona when I received Maptor. His name was soon thereafter changed to the slightly easier-to-pronounce "Dino." Shortly after that my good friend Brian asked if Dino could come along on a trip to northern Arizona to be the star of a for-fun photoshoot. And thus began what would be a series of worldwide adventures for a little purple dinosaur.

He would go on to visit airports...

Huge modern cities...

Barren deserts...

Famous museums...

Beautiful beaches...

And breathtaking mountains.

He's befriend sea-turtles...

Played a part in others' imaginations...

And he even pretended to be a chameleon one time.

This is but a short sample of the places Dino has been to. How many countries has he been to so far? We've lost count. He continues to tag along with Brian, seeing the world from his 4-inch tall perspective. Who knew a simple little toy could become such a photogenic globetrotter?
