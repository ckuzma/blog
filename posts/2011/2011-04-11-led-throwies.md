One time, as I was surfing the internet, I read an article about LED Throwies. They are easy to make, fun to use and after application could be considered a form of art. One only needs a battery, an LED diode, a magnet and some tape to make one. Because only one wouldn't be quite as much fun, I ordered enough supplies off of eBay to make 100 of them. Then when my friends came by to visit, we threw them onto the side of my apartment and then sat back with a few beers to admire out handywork.
