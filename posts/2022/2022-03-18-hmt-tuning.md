### [Afternoon Project: HMT Watch Regulation](./2022-03-18-hmt-tuning.md)

Perhaps against my better judgement I ordered myself a "refurbished" HMT wristwatch on eBay about two months ago.  A hand-wound, 17-jewel, Indian-made watch for less than $15 shipped?  I couldn't resist.

As it turns out, you get what you pay for.  My particular watch's case turned out not to be water or dust resistant in the slightest, the crystal has a habit of popping off if it is knocked just right, the hour hand doesn't exactly line up with the dial's indices and the movement in mine was running worryingly slow.  Removing the screwdown caseback revealed a surprisingly corroded movement spacer but an otherwise okay-looking movement.  A few days and some fine adjustments of the regulator and I had the watch keeping acceptable time.  (Meaning, for me, a few seconds fast per day.)

Unfortunately I don't think I'll be wearing this watch very often.  While it is quite thin and comfortable I simply can't help but worry about it in ways that never even cross my mind when I'm wearing the G-Shock from the picture above.  So for now, this little hand-wound piece is relegated to the watch case where it stands as the only HMT in my collection.
