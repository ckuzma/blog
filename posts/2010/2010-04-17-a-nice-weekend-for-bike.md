I took this picture with my N86 during the week of UO's motorcycle parking area. Er, one of them. But anyways, this is in my opinion a great picture in terms of effects (lens flare), subject (motorcycles in a line), and colors. It is of course a bit symbolic of Eugene... not really the most flashy city (only one sportbike in this picture), but has lots of character regardless. Anyways, just thought I'd share this picture. I'm going to go take a look at a bke tomorrow, and hopefully come home with it.
