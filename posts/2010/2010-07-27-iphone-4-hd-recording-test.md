I came across this little guy while doing my homework at starbucks. This video gives you a good idea of the variable-focus capabilities of the iPhone 4, as well as the surprisingly good video quality. I apologize for the focus point being not-quite on the ladybug, but ah well. It's a good example anyways. (Oh, and it is possible to change the focus point / exposure mid-video, which is very cool.)
