I said I was going to do this... and here it is. Not really the best comparison, considering that none of them have identical fields of vision, and also combined with the fact that the Nikon D40 seems to have decided to focus on a definite point in space... so take this all with a grain of salt. From what I can tell in these pictures... the iPhone 4 seems to over-saturate certain colors... the yellow tint from the sun in the upper-right hand corner and the almost complete loss of texture on the lamp-shade are the places to look for that. The color representation from the N900 is a lot better, as is the detail preservation, but the image seems over-exposed. Keeping in mind this would probably be a mistake that could be fixed prior to the image ever even being taken (thanks to the user-controllable camera settings which are missing in entirety on the iPhone 4), I wouldn't consider this so much of a problem. And because there are more details preserved in the N900, I have no doubt that I could put some minor Photoshop time into the image and receive a very similar image as that captured by the D40.
