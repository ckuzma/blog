### Casio Pro Trek PRW-3100 Review

![header-image](media/casio_prw_3100/164451.jpg)

**Introduction**

Let's cut straight to the chase: the Casio Pro Trek PRW-3100 is is _not_ a member of high-brow [haute horology](https://www.watch-wiki.net/index.php?title=Haute_Horlogerie).  Nothing about it resembles those meticulously-polished, might-as-well-be-bespoke timepieces with their eye-watering price tags and tuxedoed brand representatives.  Where those _other_ watches might hope to find themselves adorning the wrists of VIPs while they're being photographed by paparazzi, the Casio being reviewed today has the more humble goal of simply returning home in one piece after an adventure.

So who, then, is the PRW-3100 targeted at?  If it's not trying to weasel itself into what one might think of as the typical watch enthusiast's collection, then who is buying it?  And why?  In this review we'll hopefully figure that out.

**Unboxing**

Gaudy packaging, this is not.  The PRW-3100 comes in one of the most unpretentious and unassuming forms of packaging out there: a cardboard box.  Credit where it's due, it is a _nice_ looking cardboard box, especially with the minimal splash of forest green with logos for Casio and Pro Trek written in negative upon it.

Opening the top panel of the box I was greeted with what might qualify as the thickest user's guide to ever accompany a wristwatch, plus a small pop-up plackard detailing the features of Casio's Triple Sensor.  I then spied a pull tab at this point which gave further access into the box.

Lo and behold, it turns out that the PRW-3100 comes in more than just a cardboard box!  (Looking at you, Timex, and your cheap cardboard packaging.)  With an average price of around $200, perhaps this should be less of a surprise and more of an expectation.  Nevertheless it is a nice addition to the overall package, and the minimal decoration adorning it matches that of the exterior cardboard box.

The inner box itself is made out of a wood composite, and only contains the watch in a clear plastic sleeve surrounded by a thick paper holder.  (Pretty boring stuff, hence the lack of a picture.)  A hunch tells me all of the packaging has recycling / composting in mind which seems rather fitting given the types of activities an owner of this type of watch is likely to engage in.  But more on that later.

**Design**

![132241](media/casio_prw_3100/132241.jpg)

The PRW-3100 is small.  Or, at least compared to the [PRT-40 that I owned two decades ago](https://protrek.com/asia-mea/en/concept/history.html), it is.  Sitting next to my Swatch SUSB404 (pictured above), the new Pro Trek is obviously a bit bigger with its rugged protruding bezel, accidental-button-press-protectors, and fixed-angle strap attachment points being responsible for most of that extra bulk.

Taken entirely on its own and the Pro Trek looks... functional.  The colors are admittedly a bit of a mishmash, with the black band, silver buttons, blue bezel, dark purple sub-bezel, green-ish face, and white markings and labels all making a show.  That being said, _most_ of Casio's Pro Trek line are a bit garrish in terms of color choices, and when compared against the rest of its siblings the PRW-3100 appears nicely restrained.  And let's not forget that Casio also owns G-Shock, which often combines both garrish colors _and_ outlandish designs.

The multi-segmented LCD display looks undeniably old-fashioned amongst modern smartwatches yet looks right at home next to nearly any G-Shock, Suunto, Garmin or other watch aimed at the outdoors enthusiast.  The top section of the display features a small pixel array capable of displaying text such as the current mode or a graph of line (barometric pressure trends) or bar (altitude history) type.

The back of the watch has a steel case back held in place with four screws.  These are hidden underneath two plastic band-aligning pieces that are somewhat integral to the design of the watch.  These pieces help provide a more natural wrist-shaped contour to the back of the watch but aren't strictly necessary.  In fact, they would actually need to be removed should the band ever be swapped out for something else down the line.  That's slightly annoying in the same way that Swatch watches use their own proprietary band.  Thankfully, the resin strap found here is comfortable without feeling too "grippy."

The left side of the watch features the "AB" part of the ABC sensor, along with two buttons.  These metallic (presumably steel) buttons feature an embossed sunbeam design and have chamfered edges lending to a more sophisticated look.  The steel sensor cap, on the other hand, sports a simpler brushed aesthetic with two visible screws and two inlet vents inside of which a steel mesh can be seen.  Where older watches (such as the PRT-40) located their magnetic compass sensor in this position, the PRW-3100 instead exposes the temperature and barometric sensors.  There is no external indication as to where the sensor for the compass has been relocated.

On the right-hand side of the watch, it's all buttons.  These buttons feature a rugged diamond-shaped knurling for non-slip actuation with wet hands or gloves.  Clearly visible in this photo are the body protrusions that surround each button by about 1/3 on the back side to prevent their accidental depression.

The band features a simple, slightly-oversized buckle that tastefully hides an embossing ("Casio Thailand") on the underside.  No gaudy logos-just-because-we-can (ala [Invicta](../2011/2011-12-30-invicta-3449-review.md)) here!  ...mostly, anyway.  The band still sports massive "PRO TREK" raised lettering on the band, but thankfully this is usually covered by the excess strap when the watch is being worn.

**Using It**

The PRW-3100 straps easily to one's wrist, though the spacing between sizing holes on the resin band is a little farther between than I would prefer.  Once on, though, the Pro Trek feels more or less like a "normal watch" in terms of size and weight.  And this theme of "normal" can be applied to many of the PRW-3100's other attributes and features.

Something I'd learned from my short time owning a Citizen Navihawk (model JY8035-04E) is that my apartment acts similarly to a faraday cage.  While this seems to have lent itself to reliable WiFi coverage within the confines of my unit, radio signals attempting to leave or enter don't fare quite as well.  Be it 4G LTE, amateur radio transmissions, or the atomic time radio signals broadcast by [WWVB near Fort Collins, CO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWVB), these services are difficult to impossible to utilize.  This has caused the radio-synchronized clock in my bathroom to fall out of sync, rendered my transmissions to local HAMs nearly inaudible, terminated dozens of phone conversations, and effectively neutered the aforementioned Citizen wristwatch no matter where I left it in the hopes of catching a radio signal.

However things turned out to be a bit different for the PRW-3100.  Through a bit of trial and error I found out that the watch actually manages to achieve a solid signal lock of the time broadcast when placed near any of the windows.  Considering that the Pro Trek is significantly smaller than the Navihawk, I consider this a significant strength in Casio's favor.  It then probably then goes without saying that anywhere the (bigger and pricier) Citizen _had_ been able to obtain a WWVB signal, so too did the Casio, but that shouldn't come as a surprise.

When the opportunity arose to accompany a colleague on a short day hike near Seattle, the PRW-3100 came along for the adventure.  From the moment we stepped out of the car at the trailhead till our return, I kept the Pro Trek busy.  Put into altitude measurement mode– with a few brief interruptions to take compass readings– the watch never missed a beat.  Afterwards, the built-in record keeping indicated that our hike took us to an elevation of 3,235 feet above sea level, with a total ascent of 420 feet from start to finish.  Given that [the official trail information](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/lodge-lake) indicates a summit of 3,500 feet and a total of 500 feet of altitude gain, these numbers are perfectly acceptable.  Especially given that the watch relied soley on barometric pressure sensor without a trailhead altitude calibration, and readings were taken over the course of a couple of hours during which the atmospheric pressure itself could have fluctuated.

Now, while a compass wasn't necessary on our hike given the well-worn and well-populated path, I still took a few readings with the Pro Trek and compared them to a trusty Brunton that I'd also packed for the hike.  I was pleased to see both tools were in agreement with their readings, as they had varied significantly (5-10°) beforehand when used within the confines of my steel-and-cement apartment building.  Ultimately, I would have to admit that I trust the non-digital Brunton for use in a dense urban environment more than I would the Casio, if only because a physical needle can move in 3D space and thus sources of nearby magnetic field interference can be identified a little easier.

At this point you may be asking yourself when I am going to touch on the subject of solar charging.  Well, I left the watch in a window in the sun for a few hours when I first got it, and after that I've never seen the power level indicator drop below the high indicator.  That's with indoor and outdoor usage of the sensors, backlight, and WWVB synchronization.  Put simply, this watch seems to sip power and I have never found myself wondering if I'm using the watch's features too much.  It all feels very "normal" to me.  End of story.

**Conclusion**

And that's the thing about the Casio Pro Trek PRW-3100: it all feels very normal, except it isn't.  It has an easy-to-read display, a convenient LED-based backlight (which I do wish was of the more uniform Electro Luminescence-type), and a comfortable design.  But hidden amongst those basics are features that make it more than just a time keeper.  Take, for example, the barometric pressure history graph that can be displayed on the main time screen.  Most mornings I take a quick glance at that instead of my smartphone in order to figure out what clothing to wear that day.

What's amazing– beyond the fact that I snagged mine for a penny shy of a single Benjamin– is how effortlessly the PRW-3100 has worked itself into my collection and rotation of wear.  Over a decade ago I made the transition to mechanical timepieces and I never thought I'd find myself interested in a watch with a digital display again.  Sure, there was the Navihawk I briefly owned, but that was a hybrid piece incorporating technologies I was fascinated by.  The PRW-3100 has much of the same technology but _also_ rekindles the excitement of child-me that owned a PRT-40 and ran around with it taking measurements of everything I could.  Except this time, I don't have to worry about depleting an expensive button-cell battery and asking my parents for additional household chores in order to be able to afford a new one.

At the end of the day I'm pleased by the Casio Pro Trek PRW-3100.  While one might argue that it's more or less the same watch I owned [two decades ago](https://protrek.com/asia-mea/en/concept/history.html) with very little changed, I would argue that the subtle refinements throughout the years have created a highly-optimized tool.  And that's exactly what it is, because the PRW-3100 was designed to be used without tethers to another device long after smartwatches have given up the ghost.  It's a watch for those who relish in unplanned adventures.
