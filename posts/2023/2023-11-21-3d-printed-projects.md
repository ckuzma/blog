### [3D Printed Projects](./2023-11-21-3d-printed-projects.md)

The past year has been a busy time for me.  (This despite having been laid off from my shuttered company back in June.)  From making technical contributions to the tech stack behind the MVP of my brother's startup company to wrapping up my private pilot's license training in a more expedient manner, my daily routine has been anything but a vacation.  However now that the weather has turned for the season I find myself with a bit of free time to pursue the completion of existing and the exploration of new projects.

To that end I have once again found myself in need of custom housings, the latest of which I feel compelled to talk about in a more casual manner than was found in each project's repository README file.

I picked up an Orange Pi Zero 3 board with the intention of loading Batocera OS on it and utilizing it as a retro gaming system.  Unfortunately my dream of casually replaying Super Mario Bros 3 with my now-retired neighbors wwas put on hold due to support not (yet) being out for the Zero 3 board.  However in the meantime I decided to set up the computer with Ubuntu on a spare monitor for guests to use, and this case was needed to keep the computer's electrical components free from harm.

As stated in the project description, "From the very first moment I toured the house in which I currently live, I was annoyed by the eyesore that was the rat's nest of electrical twist ties holding together the HVAC system's low-voltage control lines."  This project was long overdue in terms of tidying up odds and ends around my aging house, especially before any potential showings were to happen should I find myself needing to move for my next work gig.
