As it turns out, the Samsung Galaxy S is a very funky device that can far too easily be bricked. It can also very easily be unbricked, thanks to a simple little jig that can be built at home. When I recently bricked my Galaxy S 4G (it's a T-Mobile USA variant), I panicked for quite a moment before realizing that we've a bucket full of resistors tucked away downstairs that haven't been touched since the days that my father used to bust out his breakout board and make rudimentary circuits for fun.

I found three 100K Ohm resistors, soldered 'em to the cut-off end of a USB cable (as seen above), and my phone was able to be reflashed immediately. Sometimes I think I take for granted how convenient it is to be handy with a soldering iron.
