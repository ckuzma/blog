A couple of days ago I sold my trusty ThinkPad. Here are some of the highlights from its time in my possession:
- I was about to buy a netbook when it turned out that the retailer that had it was closed for a holiday. Back at home, I came across the Lenovo being sold by another local retailer for the same price. Being both of the legendary ThinkPad name brand and sporting much better specs than the netbook, it was a no-brainer.
- One week later, the same store was selling my ThinkPad at a price increased by $200.
- For one reason or another I didn’t realize that the machine had Bluetooth built-in, until I’d owned it for a couple of months.
- During my last term of undergraduate studies, all of my final papers were written without a hitch on the TP’s excellent keyboard.
- When I moved to Germany for an internship, I left all of my USB chargers back in the States. No need to bring them and a bag of plug adapters when I had an always-on USB port.
- Oh, then there was that month that I lived in a hostel. Remember that? Yeah.
- Whoa, five-hour battery life out of a machine that isn’t known for endurance? Okay.
- Shiny and new! Windows 8! …poor battery life now, back to Windows 7!WiDi supported, that’s nice.  The ThinkPad Edge E420 was probably one of the most useful purchases I have made in my entire life. I think I can say with certainty that I’ll definitely miss that computer. I hope it makes its new owner happy.
